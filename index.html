            <p class="sectionSubTag">There no doubt about it, everyone loves reading books for different reasons. Some
                people like the escape it provides from reality, some people enjoy the connections to the characters
                they experience in each book and other people love learning things from what they read. But one thing is
                for sure:if you consider yourself a bookworm, you be able to relate to these 150 quotes about reading
                and books that we compiled.Some of the quotes are funny, some of them are inspiring and some of them are
                so accurate it is scary. You may even have heard a few of the quotes we rounded up before or you might
                be a fan of the person who said one of the quotes. But no matter what, you are sure to crack a smile as
                you go through each one on our list.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag1">Nature is made of everything we see around us trees, flowers, plants, animals,
                sky, mountains, forests and more. Human beings depend on nature to stay alive. Nature helps us breathe,
                gives us food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the
                Earth beautiful.

                Animals, fish and insects also get their food and shelter from nature. Different trees grow up due to
                sunlight and water provided by nature. Humans should stop causing harm to the elements of nature for
                their needs. Nature is very important to maintain the growth and balance of life on earth.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag2">The Earth is the third planet from the sun. It is also called the blue planet
                because it looks blue in colour from the outer surface. The Earth is the only planet that supports life
                because of the availability of air, water, and gases needed for survival. The climate of the Earth is
                mild, which is convenient for life. Due to overpopulation, the Earth is in danger and global warming is
                increasing. In order to save our Earth, we will have to take major steps and be very careful because
                there is no life possible on other planets.</p>
